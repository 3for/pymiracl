# miracl for Python

This directory includes a library for calling MIRACL from Python. Most notably, this
includes a couple implementations of fast multiexponentiation algorithms; see
`src/pymiracl/multiexp.c`.

To actually call this library from python, use the MiraclEC object defined in
the `python/pymiracl` module.

## building ##

On debian-ish systems, you'll probably need the following:

    apt-get install build-essential gcc automake pkg-config libtool libtool-bin

Other package managers should have similar requirements: you'll need a modern C
compiler (I've tested with gcc 4, 5, 6, and 7), automake, pkg-config, and libtool.

You will also need python (I've tested 2.x and 3.x) and the CFFI package to use
the Python code. It also works with PyPy (I've tested 5.x).

(If you can't figure out what packages you need, please contact me!)

Next, to build the software:

    ./autogen.sh
    ./configure
    make -j4        # for example
